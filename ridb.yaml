            <h2>Overview:</h2>The Union Creek Campground is one of the largest Forest Service campgrounds in eastern Oregon. It's nestled on the northern shore of Phillips Reservoir amid mature
            Ponderosa pine, with a few sites offering views of the lake.<br /><br />

            This camp is part of the Union Creek Recreation Area, which includes a picnic and day-use area. Union Creek Campground is set on three loops with separate walk-in tent
            camping, and it has four group sites that can accommodate from 60-100 people.<h4>Natural Features:</h4>Phillips Reservoir is a popular destination within the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest because it offers scenic views of the surrounding Elkhorn Mountains. The
            shoreline is forested with a mix of Ponderosa pine and various firs interspersed with small grasslands.<br /><br />

            Visitors enjoy several varieties of colorful wildflowers in the spring.<h4>Recreation:</h4>The campground is near a boat launch and a small, rocky swim beach. Activities include swimming, fishing, boating and water
            skiing.<br /><br />

            Anglers can fish for bass, trout and perch. There's an access point for the Phillips Lake Shoreline Trail, a 6.5-mile scenic trail for hiking and mountain biking.<h4>Facilities:</h4>The parking spurs are paved and gravel and large enough for any size RV. Several sites offer full hookups, and some others offer water and electric.<br /><br />

            Units are equipped with picnic tables and grills. Drinking water and flush toilets are available.
            Some of the facilities are handicap-accessible.<h4>Nearby Attractions:</h4>The historic gold mining town of Sumpter is about 10 miles away. Visitors can explore the Sumpter Dredge State Heritage Park, browse the holiday weekend flea
            markets or take a ride on a historic steam locomotive.
